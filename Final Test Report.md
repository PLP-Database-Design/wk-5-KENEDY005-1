## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly |Medium|
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage |High |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score |High|
| Hint function | deduct two points when used |medium |
| Scramble logic | random display of words |low |
| Guess check | validates users answers | high|

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Verify correctness of all core gameplay features.
- Confirm data persistence via leaderboard in localStorage.
- Ensure all identified risks have test coverage.
- Validate score logic, bonus doubling, and hint penalty. 

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of gameplay logic.
- Automated unit testing of key functions (Jest).
- Manual UI testing for Chrome browser (desktop).

**Out of Scope:**
- Mobile browser behavior.
- Backend server integration.
- Accessibility and performance benchmarking.
- 
- 

### Tools & Resources
- **Tools**: GitHub, Jest, VS Code, Chrome Browser
- **Resources**: index.html, gameLogic.js, game.test.js, test data words list

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| rsk1| Leaderboard|Data loss or corruption in localStorage |3 |5 |high |Validate data parsing and writing |
| rsk2|Bonus Round |Bonus applied incorrectly |3 |4 |high | Unit test bonus math, code review|
| rsk3|Hint Function | Reduces score below 0|2|2 | high| Clamp score to minimum of 0|
| rsk4|Scramble Logic |Word appears unsorted |2 |3 |medium |Add retry loop if output = input |
| rsk5|Guess Validation | Case-sensitive mismatch|3 | 3|medium |Convert both words to lowercase |
| rsk6| Guess Validation|Clears leaderboard unexpectedly | 2|5 |high | Separate reset logic from leaderboard storage|


### Risk Coverage

- Tested Risks Percent: 5 / 6 = 83.3% coverage
- Untested Risks Percent: rsk6 1/6 = 16.7
